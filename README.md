# Health Estimate
A simple module for showing estimated health level of an enemy on mouseover, similar to Baldur's Gate games.

## This project is abbandoned use instead the [fork of mclemente](https://github.com/mclemente/healthEstimate)

## Contributing
Please try to use the [develop](https://github.com/Shylight/healthEstimate/tree/develop) branch if you want to make a pull request.

For translations [GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/4792/whole_project) is the preferred method. If your language isn't available in the linked list, please contact me. In the meantime there are several languages available there that are unlikely to be in high demand, so you can use them if I'm unavailable.

Alternatively, you can use the [YAML file](src/lang/en.yml), though such approach will require more manual work when more tranlatable lines are added to the module.

## Feedback
All suggestions/feedback are appreciated, please contact me on discord (Shylight#1337) or submit a pull request.
